    <p><p style="color:#008080";> This is Archie. Archie is a 4 month old mixed breed rescue dog. I rescued him from Ahens Humane Society in <i> Watkinsville. </i> Since I got him two months ago, Life has been a whirlwind. He has got sick 3 times. First came the puppy strangles, then came coccydia, then conjuctivitis. It was a rough first month, but since then he has been super healthy! The vet was so intrigued by him because he has no idea what breed he could be. He had 3 other vets and all the vet techs come in and try and guess what he was. They guessed german sheppard, autrallian sheppard, silver lab, hound, husky, golden retreiver and many more. I bought a DNA test and plan to post my results over on my other webpage.He is a quirky little pup so I decided to list his likes and dislikes in the table below so you can know him a little better . </p>
    <p> <p style="color:#008080";> Archie is the best but also the worst thing to happen to me. I never knew a puppy could be so much work and money! His vet bills cut my savings in half and I dont think I have gotten a full nights sleep since I got him. he wakes up at least once in the middle of the night to go potty. It sucks but its all worth it because he is so cute and so loving. </p>
