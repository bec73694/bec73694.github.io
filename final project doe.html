    <h1>The Cutest Puppy</h1>
    <p>Welcome to a webpage made jusdt for my pup!</p>
    <p>This is Archie. Archie is a 4 month old mixed breed rescue dog. I rescued him from Ahens Humane Society in Watkinsville. Since I got him two months ago, Life has been a whirlwind. He has got sick 3 times. First came the puppy strangles, then came coccydia, then conjuctivitis. It was a rough first month, but since then he has been super healthy! The vet was so intrigued by him because he has no idea what breed he could be. He had 3 other vets and all the vet techs come in and try and guess what he was. They guessed german sheppard, autrallian sheppard, silver lab, hound, husky, golden retreiver and many more. I bought a DNA test and plan to post my results over on my other webpage.He is a quirky little pup so I decided to list his likes and dislikes in the table below so you can know him a little better .  </p>
